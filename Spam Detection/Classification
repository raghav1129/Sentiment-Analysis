Spam Detection is a Classification task used to classify text sms as Spam and Ham
The csv files conatins two columns: 
v1 : which is the label ('ham', 'spam')
v2 : the text matches.

We try to classify the text into Spam or Ham using Natural Language Processing NLTK and perform the required text-processing. I try to implement two models here the the Naive Bayes model and the Random Forest model and check their accuracy.
